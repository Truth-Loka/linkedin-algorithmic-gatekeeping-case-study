### 📂 Repository Contents

* **`forensic_analysis_report.md`**: The full investigative report.
* **`raw_comments_log_anonymized.txt`**: Raw text logs of the interaction for NLP analysis.
* **`urn_decoder.py`**: Python script to mathematically verify the timestamps from LinkedIn server data.

### 🔍 Key Findings

#### 1. The "Impossible" Timeline (Verified via URN)
Metadata analysis of the LinkedIn Unique Resource Names (URNs) reveals a statistically improbable reaction time.
* **Article Published:** Nov 23, 2025 - 01:00 AM (approx)
* **Rebuttal Posted:** ~22 minutes later
* **Activity:** In this window, the account located **4 specific peer-reviewed studies** (BMJ, PNAS) and synthesized a multi-part structured rebuttal.
* **Conclusion:** This speed suggests the use of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** tools.

#### 2. The "Sleeper" Profile
The user profile exhibits a structural contradiction: generic "job recruiter" posting history vs. expert-level toxicology commentary.
