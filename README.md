Forensic analysis of coordinated inauthentic behavior on LinkedIn
# Forensic Analysis: Algorithmic Gatekeeping on Scientific Discourse (LinkedIn Case Study)

### 🚨 Overview
This repository contains forensic data, logs, and analysis regarding anomalous user behavior observed on LinkedIn following the publication of the article *"Autism: Silent Epidemic or Diagnostic Overestimation?"* on November 23, 2025.

The objective of this archive is to document patterns consistent with **AI-assisted astroturfing** and **reputation management operations** (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation) aimed at suppressing scientific inquiry into environmental toxicology.

### 🔍 Key Forensic Findings

#### 1. The "Impossible" Timeline (URN Analysis)
Metadata analysis of the LinkedIn Unique Resource Names (URNs) reveals a statistically improbable reaction time.
* **Article Published:** Nov 23, 2025
* **Rebuttal Posted:** ~22 minutes later
* **Content:** A multi-part, structured rebuttal citing **4 specific peer-reviewed studies** (BMJ, PNAS) with extracted data points.
* **Conclusion:** Manual research, reading, and synthesis of this depth in <25 minutes is virtually impossible for a human operator. This suggests the use of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** tools connected to a scientific database.

#### 2. The "Sleeper" Profile Discrepancy
The user profile ("Jacques Lefebvre") exhibits a structural contradiction:
* **Posting Activity:** Exclusively posts generic HR/Job offers (typical of bot/sleeper accounts to simulate activity).
* **Commenting Activity:** exclusively engages in high-level expert debunking on specific controversial topics (Toxicology, Geopolitics, French Politics).
* **Pattern:** This "Full Spectrum" institutional defense alignment is consistent with managed personas rather than organic user behavior.

#### 3. The "Polite Squatter" Strategy
The account utilizes a "Flooding" technique: systematically replying to *every* third-party comment to dilute positive engagement and enforce a specific scientific consensus using pre-scripted narratives.

### 🛠 Methodology
* **Timestamp Verification:** Converted LinkedIn URNs (Snowflake IDs) to Unix Timestamps to verify exact posting times, bypassing frontend display manipuation ("1d ago").
* **Behavioral Profiling:** Cross-referenced user's post history vs. comment history.

### ⚖️ Disclaimer & License
This data is provided for **research and educational purposes** to foster transparency in digital scientific discourse.
* **Privacy:** Personal identifiers of unconnected third parties have been redacted. The subject of the analysis is a public profile engaged in public debate.
