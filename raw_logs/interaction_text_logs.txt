Even if only one person was vaccine injured, thorough research should still be done.
Worryingly, the numbers are far greater.

Philip, I’m with you on the first sentence, actually: if one person has a serious vaccine injury, the right response is to investigate properly and fold what we learn back into practice. That’s how the myocarditis signal in young men was picked up, quantified, and fed into age/sex/product guidance.

Where I’d nudge a bit is the rest:

- “Silence” isn’t quite right: the trials, product information, and safety updates have always listed adverse events, even if the public messaging was way too slogan-heavy (“safe and effective”) and much too light on nuance.

- “The numbers are far greater” needs receipts: which outcome, which dataset, what rate per 100,000, and how does that compare with background and with Covid itself?

If there’s solid evidence a particular harm is more common than regulators have acknowledged, I’m all for putting that on the table. But to help patients rather than just scare them, we need exactly the details your meme leaves out: definition, denominators, and a clear comparison. That’s the kind of transparency that improves both safety and trust.

Is a global measles outbreak happening now? Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can have serious complications, especially for young children and people with weakened immune systems. In recent years, there have been concerns about a potential global measles outbreak due to declining vaccination rates and increased international travel. In this video, we'll explore the current state of measles around the world, discuss the factors contributing to its spread, and examine the efforts being made to prevent and control outbreaks. With measles cases on the rise in many countries, it's essential to understand the risks and take steps to protect yourself and your community. Stay informed and stay safe - watch now to learn more about the potential for a global measles outbreak.

Short answer: we’re not in a 1960s-style, wall-to-wall measles pandemic, but we are seeing exactly what you’d expect when coverage slips below the herd-immunity threshold: repeated, avoidable outbreaks in undervaccinated pockets.

A few points I’d add to your framing:
- Measles’ R0 is brutal; once first-dose coverage drops much below approximately 95% in a community, the virus doesn’t need much “help” from travel to take off.
- The severe outcomes we worry about (pneumonia, encephalitis, immune amnesia) still land overwhelmingly in the unvaccinated or under-vaccinated; 2-dose recipients have a very low risk of both infection and bad complications.
- “Global outbreak” isn’t destiny; it’s a function of how fast we close immunity gaps with catch-up campaigns, especially in kids and HCWs, rather than just watching the curves and arguing about them.

So yes, people should understand the risk, but the most useful takeaway, in my view, is very practical:
- check your own measles immunity,
- support catch-up programmes where coverage has sagged,
- and make sure the conversation is about how to restore protection, not just another episode of “look how bad things are getting”.

What is the pathology associated with Covid reinfections in the vaccinated?
Why would it not be a priority?

Philip, I’m with you that skipping autopsies is a lost chance, especially for something as new and layered as Covid + reinfection + vaccination.

A few thoughts I’d add:
- Early Covid autopsies changed practice; they nailed down diffuse alveolar damage, microthrombi, endothelial injury, etc. Without that tissue work we’d have been flying blind.
- For reinfections in vaccinated people, pathology is much less mapped. We’ve got scattered reports (lungs, heart, brain), but not a systematic series with:
i) clear vaccination + infection history,
ii) standardised cardiac / pulmonary / neuro sampling, and
iii) linkage back to denominators so we know how often each pattern occurs.

That, to me, is the key: autopsies are essential for mechanism, but they can’t answer “how frequent, in whom?” on their own. The priority shouldn’t just be “more autopsies” but better-integrated ones:
- standard protocols in sudden/unexpected deaths after recent Covid,
- plus linkage to registries, imaging, and lab data in the living.

If we did that, we’d move from powerful slogans to a concrete map of which lesions really track with reinfections in the vaccinated, and how big that problem is compared with other Covid-era harms.

Partie 1.

Avant de parler de “morts fantômes” ou de “fraude scientifique”, il est nécessaire de rappeler les faits autour de l’étude Pradelle-Lega : ce travail a effectivement estimé qu’environ 17 000 décès liés à l’hydroxychloroquine auraient pu survenir dans six pays lors de la première vague Covid-19, en se basant sur des méta-analyses publiées. Mais cette estimation a été rétractée par la revue, précisément pour des raisons de fiabilité méthodologique : le risque initial était calculé en extrapolant à l’ensemble des patients des niveaux de surmortalité observés lors d’essais menés avec des doses parfois très élevées et sur des populations différentes, sans correction par dose ou contexte clinique.​
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/Why-a-major-hydroxychloroquine-study-was-retracted-over-statistical-misuse.aspx

La vraie science ne s’écrit pas sur YouTube ni sur Rance-Soir : elle se construit par la confrontation, le débat, la correction des erreurs et la transparence sur les limites des estimations. L’étude n’a pas été “frauduleuse” : elle a été critiquée, son intervalle de confiance était large (entre 3 000 et 30 000 morts possibles), et le choix d’extrapoler sans données spécifiques s’est avéré problématique.

thierry marchal Thierry, il est compréhensible que beaucoup de médecins aient douté de l’extrapolation des 17 000 décès ; la méthodologie posait effectivement problème et la critique était justifiée. Mais qualifier l’étude de “commande par un labo” n’est pas fondé : il n’existe aucune preuve ni conflit d’intérêt établi dans ce sens, et la rétractation du papier a été motivée par des erreurs méthodologiques, pas par une manipulation industrielle.​

L’hydroxychloroquine a été, comme vous le rappellez, massivement utilisée dans le monde, mais justement : des essais randomisés et méta-analyses indépendantes, publiés depuis 2020, n’ont jamais réussi à démontrer une efficacité contre le Covid-19, et ont même montré des risques accrus d’effets secondaires graves dans certains contextes. La polémique autour du médicament tient moins à un complot qu’à un vrai débat scientifique, parfois trop vite politisé.​
https://www.numerama.com/sciences/1868502-letude-polemique-de-raoult-sur-la-chloroquine-enfin-retractee-elle-na-plus-aucune-valeur.html

La science avance ainsi, par le débat, pas par le soupçon généralisé. Accuser sans preuve, c’est rendre impossible la correction et la progression des connaissances.

Serious claim; please share specifics so people can evaluate:

- Who said what, when, and under oath (deposition/trial name, date)?
- Direct quotes + full transcript/video link (not clips).
- Context: exact question asked, exhibits shown, and whether the statement was later clarified or corrected.
- Relevance: which policy or guidance does this change, and what’s the effect size for the public?

Selective snippets can mislead as much as press soundbites. If there’s a contradiction, the remedy is sunlight: post the primary record so everyone can read it end-to-end.

Richard Aguilera I get what you’re asking for, Richard: a single, huge, double-blind, saline-placebo RCT of the entire childhood schedule for years.

Part 1.

Two problems with treating that as the entry ticket for “safety”:

1. It’s not ethically doable.
To run your ideal trial you’d have to randomise thousands of kids to no protection against measles, polio, tetanus, Hib, etc., for years, purely to satisfy methodological purity. Every modern ethics board would (rightly) block that. We don’t demand RCTs of “full seatbelt package vs no seatbelts for 5 years” either: once individual components show benefit and withholding them is clearly harmful, that design is off the table.

2. “Not this exact RCT” doesn't mean “no safety data”.
What we do have is:
- Randomised, placebo-controlled trials for individual vaccines and for several combinations, with follow-up beyond 4 weeks for serious adverse events.
- Large post-licensure cohort and case–control studies comparing kids on different schedules or with different doses/brands.
- Ongoing pharmacovigilance pulling in millions of person-years of real-world data.
None of that is perfect, but together it’s how we evaluate any intervention once a big “no-vax” RCT is unethical.

🧩 The vaccine question everyone avoids: Why do some children regress after vaccination while population studies show no risk increase?
My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.
The article includes a graph showing autism diagnoses corrected for diagnostic expansion, overlaid with glyphosate introduction into food supply. The correlation is striking—and backed by mechanistic studies in BMJ and PNAS.
This isn't anti-vaccine. It's anti-oversimplification.

I have a son with autism and have acted as an advocate for other families. And I have thought about the how and why A LOT. 

First, having a different way of processing info - like Mac v pc - isn’t bad. How well kids adapt and deal with overwhelming sensory and social situations is huge. Many will learn how to function and excel in life. Others will need supports. A diagnosis doesn’t tell parents which one they have. The road the parents and all the service providers take the kid on - that’s what decides. 

Back to WHY. 

Sometimes it’s genetic. My son is just like his grandma. Undiagnosed but clearly someone with different processing and social skills. But there are families with no other people with autism. Here’s what I think. If you imagine that the brain is a sheet of glass… for most people it’s intact and strong. Thoughts move around and through. But for a few, that sheet of glass has some little cracks. If there are no traumatic incidents, no problem. If there’s high fever or a head injury, or maybe too many vaccines, the little crack spreads and causes distortions in the ability to process. 

Makes it all makes sense to me. 

Most important thing - early intervention. Don’t hope it’s not autism.

Elaine Wooton I really appreciate you sharing this, Elaine, both the mum/advocate hat and the “Mac vs PC” framing. That resonates a lot more than the usual doom language.

Part 1.

What you say about the “sheet of glass with tiny cracks” is also very close to how a lot of researchers now think about it:
- for some kids the wiring difference is overwhelmingly genetic and runs in families,
- for others there’s likely a mix of genetics + pregnancy/birth factors + early-life stressors that tip a vulnerable system into visible difficulty.

Where I’d add one small nuance is on the “maybe too many vaccines” part. Big, well-controlled studies (hundreds of thousands of kids, including those at higher familial risk) haven’t found that more vaccines, or the timing of vaccines, increase autism risk overall; which doesn’t disprove your “cracks and triggers” metaphor, but does suggest that if vaccines are a trigger for anyone, it’s rare enough that we can’t see it at a population level. Infections, prematurity, hypoxia, major fevers, etc. are probably doing more of the heavy lifting in that “big stressor” category.

BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
 
 "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
 
 "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
 
 "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
 
 "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism." 
 
 "Of note, the 2014 Agency for Health Research and Quality review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month." 
 
 "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
 
 As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

Lindsay Kolasa Of course Jan has biases, so do you, so do I. Being “groomed in conventional medicine” doesn’t remove bias, but it does at least give you tools that are supposed to reduce it: trial design, confounding, Bayesian priors, error bars, etc.

That’s really the issue here.

If you think those critiques are wrong, the most helpful thing wouldn’t be to call out Jan’s background, but to point us to the single strongest analysis or figure in the report and explain why you think it overturns that wider body of evidence. I’m very happy to look at that with you – bias is unavoidable, which is exactly why methods and data have to carry the argument, not our CVs.

BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
 
 "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
 
 "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
 
 "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
 
 "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism." 
 
 "Of note, the 2014 Agency for Health Research and Quality review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month." 
 
 "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
 
 As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

Lindsay Kolasa Of course Jan has biases, so do you, so do I. Being “groomed in conventional medicine” doesn’t remove bias, but it does at least give you tools that are supposed to reduce it: trial design, confounding, Bayesian priors, error bars, etc.

The McCullough Foundation graphic isn’t being questioned because it’s unpopular, it’s being questioned because it leans heavily on ecological curves and selective citations while large, well-controlled cohorts (MMR, thimerosal, schedule, etc.) keep failing to show a vaccine→autism signal.

Serious claim; please share specifics so people can evaluate:

- Who said what, when, and under oath (deposition/trial name, date)?
- Direct quotes + full transcript/video link (not clips).
- Context: exact question asked, exhibits shown, and whether the statement was later clarified or corrected.
- Relevance: which policy or guidance does this change, and what’s the effect size for the public?

Selective snippets can mislead as much as press soundbites. If there’s a contradiction, the remedy is sunlight: post the primary record so everyone can read it end-to-end.

Richard Aguilera I get what you’re asking for, Richard: a single, huge, double-blind, saline-placebo RCT of the entire childhood schedule for years.

Part 1.

Two problems with treating that as the entry ticket for “safety”:

1. It’s not ethically doable.
To run your ideal trial you’d have to randomise thousands of kids to no protection against measles, polio, tetanus, Hib, etc., for years, purely to satisfy methodological purity. Every modern ethics board would (rightly) block that. We don’t demand RCTs of “full seatbelt package vs no seatbelts for 5 years” either: once individual components show benefit and withholding them is clearly harmful, that design is off the table.

2. “Not this exact RCT” doesn't mean “no safety data”.
What we do have is:
- Randomised, placebo-controlled trials for individual vaccines and for several combinations, with follow-up beyond 4 weeks for serious adverse events.
- Large post-licensure cohort and case–control studies comparing kids on different schedules or with different doses/brands.
- Ongoing pharmacovigilance pulling in millions of person-years of real-world data.
None of that is perfect, but together it’s how we evaluate any intervention once a big “no-vax” RCT is unethical.

2. “Not this exact RCT” doesn't mean “no safety data”.
What we do have is:
- Randomised, placebo-controlled trials for individual vaccines and for several combinations, with follow-up beyond 4 weeks for serious adverse events.
- Large post-licensure cohort and case–control studies comparing kids on different schedules or with different doses/brands.
- Ongoing pharmacovigilance pulling in millions of person-years of real-world data.
None of that is perfect, but together it’s how we evaluate any intervention once a big “no-vax” RCT is unethical.

🧩 The vaccine question everyone avoids: Why do some children regress after vaccination while population studies show no risk increase?
My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.
The article includes a graph showing autism diagnoses corrected for diagnostic expansion, overlaid with glyphosate introduction into food supply. The correlation is striking—and backed by mechanistic studies in BMJ and PNAS.
This isn't anti-vaccine. It's anti-oversimplification.

I have a son with autism and have acted as an advocate for other families. And I have thought about the how and why A LOT. 

First, having a different way of processing info - like Mac v pc - isn’t bad. How well kids adapt and deal with overwhelming sensory and social situations is huge. Many will learn how to function and excel in life. Others will need supports. A diagnosis doesn’t tell parents which one they have. The road the parents and all the service providers take the kid on - that’s what decides. 

Back to WHY. 

Sometimes it’s genetic. My son is just like his grandma. Undiagnosed but clearly someone with different processing and social skills. But there are families with no other people with autism. Here’s what I think. If you imagine that the brain is a sheet of glass… for most people it’s intact and strong. Thoughts move around and through. But for a few, that sheet of glass has some little cracks. If there are no traumatic incidents, no problem. If there’s high fever or a head injury, or maybe too many vaccines, the little crack spreads and causes distortions in the ability to process. 

Makes it all makes sense to me. 

Most important thing - early intervention. Don’t hope it’s not autism.

Elaine Wooton I really appreciate you sharing this, Elaine, both the mum/advocate hat and the “Mac vs PC” framing. That resonates a lot more than the usual doom language.

Part 1.

What you say about the “sheet of glass with tiny cracks” is also very close to how a lot of researchers now think about it:
- for some kids the wiring difference is overwhelmingly genetic and runs in families,
- for others there’s likely a mix of genetics + pregnancy/birth factors + early-life stressors that tip a vulnerable system into visible difficulty.

Where I’d add one small nuance is on the “maybe too many vaccines” part. Big, well-controlled studies (hundreds of thousands of kids, including those at higher familial risk) haven’t found that more vaccines, or the timing of vaccines, increase autism risk overall; which doesn’t disprove your “cracks and triggers” metaphor, but does suggest that if vaccines are a trigger for anyone, it’s rare enough that we can’t see it at a population level. Infections, prematurity, hypoxia, major fevers, etc. are probably doing more of the heavy lifting in that “big stressor” category.

BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
 
 "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
 
 "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
 
 "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
 
 "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism." 
 
 "Of note, the 2014 Agency for Health Research and Quality review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month." 
 
 "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
 
 As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

Lindsay Kolasa Of course Jan has biases, so do you, so do I. Being “groomed in conventional medicine” doesn’t remove bias, but it does at least give you tools that are supposed to reduce it: trial design, confounding, Bayesian priors, error bars, etc.

That’s really the issue here. The McCullough Foundation graphic isn’t being questioned because it’s unpopular, it’s being questioned because it leans heavily on ecological curves and selective citations while large, well-controlled cohorts (MMR, thimerosal, schedule, etc.) keep failing to show a vaccine→autism signal.

If you think those critiques are wrong, the most helpful thing wouldn’t be to call out Jan’s background, but to point us to the single strongest analysis or figure in the report and explain why you think it overturns that wider body of evidence. I’m very happy to look at that with you – bias is unavoidable, which is exactly why methods and data have to carry the argument, not our CVs.

«J’estime que le mot «folie» n’est qu’un euphémisme pour décrire ce qui se passe actuellement à Bruxelles. La presse mondiale parle d'une mafia militaire opérant en Ukraine, d'un pouvoir d’État corrompu, et pourtant, la présidente de la Commission européenne, Mme von der Leyen, veut envoyer 100 milliards d'euros supplémentaires, provenant des citoyens européens, à l'Ukraine. C'est tout simplement de la folie», a déclaré vendredi le ministre hongrois des Affaires étrangères. 

Peter Szijjarto a ajouté qu’on ne pouvait pas envoyer de l'argent européen à une mafia militaire, à un régime corrompu.

«Ces paiements doivent cesser.»

Christian, avant de répéter les slogans sur la “mafia militaire ukrainienne”, il faudrait regarder les chiffres et la réalité : l’Union européenne et ses États membres ont versé à ce jour autour de 131 à 138 milliards d’euros à l’Ukraine (aide militaire, financière, humanitaire), tous ces fonds étant conditionnés par des contrôles et des audits, avec plusieurs versements suspendus ou ajustés en cas d’anomalie.​
https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/guerre-en-ukraine-le-desengagement-americain-compense-par-l-aide-europeenne-selon-le-kiel-institute-20250616

Oui, la corruption reste un problème en Ukraine : Bruxelles et les principaux donateurs insistent justement sur la transparence, le contrôle des dépenses et le suivi indépendant. D’ailleurs, la Hongrie, qui dénonce la “folie” des aides, participe elle-même très faiblement à ce soutien et fait régulièrement l’objet de critiques pour son manque de rigueur financière dans ses propres fonds européens.​

Accuser les Ukrainiens de tous les maux sans reconnaître la guerre d’agression russe, les crimes commis et la nécessité de défendre un pays en pleine invasion, c’est travestir la situation. Refuser toute aide, c’est condamner des millions de civils à la loi du plus fort.
Guerre en Ukraine : le désengagement américain compensé par l’aide européenne, selon le Kiel Institute
Les premiers donateurs sont l’Union européenne et ses membres (131 milliards d’euros donnés ou alloués), les États-Unis (115 milliards) et le Royaume-Uni (19 milliards).

Elaine Wooton I really appreciate you sharing this, Elaine, both the mum/advocate hat and the “Mac vs PC” framing. That resonates a lot more than the usual doom language.

Part 1.

What you say about the “sheet of glass with tiny cracks” is also very close to how a lot of researchers now think about it:
- for some kids the wiring difference is overwhelmingly genetic and runs in families,
- for others there’s likely a mix of genetics + pregnancy/birth factors + early-life stressors that tip a vulnerable system into visible difficulty.

Where I’d add one small nuance is on the “maybe too many vaccines” part. Big, well-controlled studies (hundreds of thousands of kids, including those at higher familial risk) haven’t found that more vaccines, or the timing of vaccines, increase autism risk overall; which doesn’t disprove your “cracks and triggers” metaphor, but does suggest that if vaccines are a trigger for anyone, it’s rare enough that we can’t see it at a population level. Infections, prematurity, hypoxia, major fevers, etc. are probably doing more of the heavy lifting in that “big stressor” category.

🧩 The vaccine question everyone avoids: Why do some children regress after vaccination while population studies show no risk increase?
My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.
The article includes a graph showing autism diagnoses corrected for diagnostic expansion, overlaid with glyphosate introduction into food supply. The correlation is striking—and backed by mechanistic studies in BMJ and PNAS.
This isn't anti-vaccine. It's anti-oversimplification.

I have a son with autism and have acted as an advocate for other families. And I have thought about the how and why A LOT. 

First, having a different way of processing info - like Mac v pc - isn’t bad. How well kids adapt and deal with overwhelming sensory and social situations is huge. Many will learn how to function and excel in life. Others will need supports. A diagnosis doesn’t tell parents which one they have. The road the parents and all the service providers take the kid on - that’s what decides. 

Back to WHY. 

Sometimes it’s genetic. My son is just like his grandma. Undiagnosed but clearly someone with different processing and social skills. But there are families with no other people with autism. Here’s what I think. If you imagine that the brain is a sheet of glass… for most people it’s intact and strong. Thoughts move around and through. But for a few, that sheet of glass has some little cracks. If there are no traumatic incidents, no problem. If there’s high fever or a head injury, or maybe too many vaccines, the little crack spreads and causes distortions in the ability to process. 

Makes it all makes sense to me. 

Most important thing - early intervention. Don’t hope it’s not autism.

Alfredo De Joannon Alfredo, I see what you’re getting at with the Bayer angle: structural incentives are real, and disclosure of roles is absolutely fair game.

Where I’d add one nuance is that who someone works for can explain their priors, but it doesn’t, by itself, answer the scientific question. In the end we still have to come back to:
- which studies,
- which exposure levels,
- which biomarkers and outcomes,
- and what sort of prospective design would be capable of proving your “perfect storm” model right or wrong.

If Simon shows up, I’d actually welcome him into that conversation, but on terms where nobody’s CV (yours, his, Michael’s, mine) settles anything. Lay out the BMJ/PNAS evidence, ask him which parts he thinks are flawed or dose-unrealistic, and then ask what kind of independent cohort he would accept as decisive.

On that, I think we still agree: the way past firewalls and tribalism isn’t to exclude voices by affiliation, it’s to anchor the debate in transparent methods and data that don’t belong to any one camp. If this thread helps nudge funders toward such independent work, the mix of provocation and pushback will have been worth it.

Jacques,
I’m genuinely impressed by how you’ve stewarded this discussion. In just a few hours you turned a potential standoff into one of the most constructive exchanges I’ve seen here.
We now agree on the essentials:
Retrospective epidemiology has hit its ceiling at population level.
The future is prospective cohorts built around biology (microbiome, toxicants, immune markers) and vulnerable subgroups.
My “perfect storm” model is a hypothesis-generating framework, not a solved puzzle, and its whole purpose is to guide the rigorous research we both say is now the priority.
If this thread nudges even one funder or team toward that next level of study, your meticulous nit-picking and my deliberate provocation will have done their job perfectly.
(And yes, the Guinness-level bookmark game remains legendary 😄)
Thank you, Jacques, Victoria, Amalia, Maureen, Carolyn, and everyone who jumped in.
Matthew — the invitation still stands: a precise, data-driven critique from your IACC experience would be the cherry on top.
For now, let’s call this debate successfully elevated to the only place it ever needed to go:
“Let’s design the studies that can actually answer the question.”
Thanks again, Jacques. Exceptional exchange.

Alfredo De Joannon Nice of you to say that, Alfredo; thank you for staying in the arena instead of treating pushback as attack.

If I had to bottle where we landed, I’d phrase it like this:
- Retrospective big-data work has taken the “vaccines > autism” question about as far as it can at the population level.
- The interesting questions now live in biology-anchored subgroups (microbiome, toxicant load, immune signatures) and that needs prospective designs, not just bigger billing databases.
- Your “perfect storm” diagram is a map of what to test, not a verdict, and I really appreciate how explicit you’ve been about that.

My only small addendum is that I wouldn’t throw retrospective epi in the bin: it’s still great for scoping signals and checking whether a proposed mechanism could plausibly move rates in the real world. But we both agree it can’t, on its own, settle the kind of finely grained vulnerability you’re talking about.

If this thread nudges even one group toward a protocol that says, “Here are the biomarkers, here’s the exposure window, here’s what would falsify our model,” that will be a genuine win, for science and for families who are tired of watching people shout past each other.

Quick update after 700+ views and 50+ comments
A pediatric ER physician (Dr Michael Falk, Mount Sinai) just accused me of “moving the goalposts” and “another attempt at blaming vaccines.”
His comment came after:
the article had explicitly ruled out vaccines as a population-level cause
Jacques Lefebvre and I had reached full agreement on prospective studies
Victoria North had shared direct lab experience on glyphosate/immunity
Yet the reflex fired the moment “vaccine” appeared near “autism.”
This is the exact epistemological firewall the article described: any nuance is instantly read as an anti-vax threat, even when the author says the opposite.
Not a personal criticism of Dr Falk (whom I thank for his frontline work), but a real-time demonstration of how hard it is to discuss individual biological vulnerability without being categorised.
Paradox: the fiercest vaccine defenders sometimes block the very research that would protect programmes long-term — identifying the possible 0.01% who might be vulnerable.
Thank you all for keeping this thread at the level of science rather than tribe.
Consensus with Jacques stands: we need prospective research on microbiome, toxicants, and immune biomarkers. Full stop.

Alfredo De Joannon Francis, I appreciate how you’ve handled the thread, and I’m glad our “consensus with Jacques” made it into your recap.

I do get why someone like Michael reacts so fast when “vaccine” and “autism” appear in the same paragraph: for 20+ years that pairing has usually meant “vaccines are the cause,” and he’s spent a career pushing back on that. The reflex is understandable; it’s just not very helpful for the more nuanced question you’re asking.

For what it’s worth, I don’t read your piece as goal-post shifting. You’re quite explicit that vaccines aren’t a major population-level driver, and that the interesting part now is whether a very small, biologically primed subgroup exists at all, and if so, how we’d detect it before an immune hit (infection or vaccine).

Where I’d soften your wording a bit is the idea that “defenders block research”. In my view the real blocker isn’t people like Michael per se, it’s the lack of concrete, prospective protocols on the table: who to recruit, which biomarkers, what sample size, what falsifies the hypothesis. If we can move the discussion from “are you for or against vaccines” to “here’s the study design that would prove this right or wrong”.

BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
 
 "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
 
 "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
 
 "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
 
 "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism." 
 
 "Of note, the 2014 Agency for Health Research and Quality review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month." 
 
 "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
 
 As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

Lindsay Kolasa Of course Jan has biases, so do you, so do I. Being “groomed in conventional medicine” doesn’t remove bias, but it does at least give you tools that are supposed to reduce it: trial design, confounding, Bayesian priors, error bars, etc.

That’s really the issue here. The McCullough Foundation graphic isn’t being questioned because it’s unpopular, it’s being questioned because it leans heavily on ecological curves and selective citations while large, well-controlled cohorts (MMR, thimerosal, schedule, etc.) keep failing to show a vaccine→autism signal.

If you think those critiques are wrong, the most helpful thing wouldn’t be to call out Jan’s background, but to point us to the single strongest analysis or figure in the report and explain why you think it overturns that wider body of evidence. I’m very happy to look at that with you – bias is unavoidable, which is exactly why methods and data have to carry the argument, not our CVs.

⏺Viktor Orbаn sur la façon dont Kiev a dépensé l'argent des Européens pour une guerre « impossible à gagner sur le champ de bataille ».

La guerre entre la hashtag#Russie et l’Ukraine a amené l’Europe au seuil d’un tournant historique. Le président @realDonaldTrump ne renonce pas à la volonté d’établir la paix en Ukraine.

À présent, l’hashtag#Europe se retrouve face à deux chemins.

Nous pouvons tous nous unir autour de l’initiative de paix du président hashtag#Trump, y compris les bureaucrates bruxellois, pour enfin sortir de cette impasse. Cela obligerait les dirigeants va-t-en-guerre à se rendre à l’évidence qu’au cours des 3,5 dernières années, ils ont dépensé l’argent durement gagné des Européens dans une guerre qui ne peut être gagnée sur le champ de bataille.

L’autre chemin mène directement à la guerre. Si les dirigeants bellicistes européens continuent d’injecter de l’argent et des armes en Ukraine sans le soutien des États-Unis, ils paveront la voie à un conflit russo-hashtag#européen. L’Europe sait trop bien où mène ce chemin, dont les conséquences ont été tragiques.

La rhétorique d’Orbán et de certains “pro-Trump” de l'extrême-droite vise à faire croire qu’il n’existerait qu’un choix binaire : la capitulation ou la guerre totale. Or, la réalité est plus complexe. Ce sont les agressions militaires russes, pas les aides occidentales, qui ont déclenché le conflit et forcé l’Ukraine à se défendre. L’argent dépensé par l’Europe et l’OTAN n’a pas créé la guerre : il a permis à une population bombardée et envahie de résister à une annexion violente.​
https://www.lepoint.fr/monde/viktor-orban-en-solo-mais-decontracte-au-conseil-europeen-sur-la-defense-et-l-ukraine-07-03-2025-2584115_24.php

Qualifier la paix de Trump d’“unique alternative” est trompeur : ses plans présumés impliquent souvent la cession de territoires ukrainiens à la Russie, sans concertation avec Kiev et en violation du droit international. L’Europe n’a pas intérêt à voir force et impunité remplacer la règle de droit ; ce serait ouvrir la porte à d’autres agressions, et livrer les démocraties à la loi du plus fort.​

Soutenir l’Ukraine, c’est défendre le principe que la sécurité en Europe ne se marchande pas contre des concessions imposées par la force.
Viktor Orban, en solo mais décontracté au Conseil européen sur la défense et l’Ukraine
L’opposition du Hongrois aux conclusions sur l’Ukraine n’a pas soulevé l’émoi habituel à Bruxelles. Elle n’a pas de conséquence sur la situation de Kiev. Et Orban s’en est tranquillement expliqué.

En retour, il n’y a pas eu de “discrédit mondial” mais un débat scientifique légitime, qui a permis d’éviter la généralisation d’un traitement inefficace voire risqué, comme démontré par d’autres essais randomisés.​

Partie 1.

Avant de parler de “morts fantômes” ou de “fraude scientifique”, il est nécessaire de rappeler les faits autour de l’étude Pradelle-Lega : ce travail a effectivement estimé qu’environ 17 000 décès liés à l’hydroxychloroquine auraient pu survenir dans six pays lors de la première vague Covid-19, en se basant sur des méta-analyses publiées. Mais cette estimation a été rétractée par la revue, précisément pour des raisons de fiabilité méthodologique : le risque initial était calculé en extrapolant à l’ensemble des patients des niveaux de surmortalité observés lors d’essais menés avec des doses parfois très élevées et sur des populations différentes, sans correction par dose ou contexte clinique.​
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250506/Why-a-major-hydroxychloroquine-study-was-retracted-over-statistical-misuse.aspx

La vraie science ne s’écrit pas sur YouTube ni sur Rance-Soir : elle se construit par la confrontation, le débat, la correction des erreurs et la transparence sur les limites des estimations. L’étude n’a pas été “frauduleuse” : elle a été critiquée, son intervalle de confiance était large (entre 3 000 et 30 000 morts possibles), et le choix d’extrapoler sans données spécifiques s’est avéré problématique.

thierry marchal Thierry, il est compréhensible que beaucoup de médecins aient douté de l’extrapolation des 17 000 décès ; la méthodologie posait effectivement problème et la critique était justifiée. Mais qualifier l’étude de “commande par un labo” n’est pas fondé : il n’existe aucune preuve ni conflit d’intérêt établi dans ce sens, et la rétractation du papier a été motivée par des erreurs méthodologiques, pas par une manipulation industrielle.​

L’hydroxychloroquine a été, comme vous le rappellez, massivement utilisée dans le monde, mais justement : des essais randomisés et méta-analyses indépendantes, publiés depuis 2020, n’ont jamais réussi à démontrer une efficacité contre le Covid-19, et ont même montré des risques accrus d’effets secondaires graves dans certains contextes. La polémique autour du médicament tient moins à un complot qu’à un vrai débat scientifique, parfois trop vite politisé.​
https://www.numerama.com/sciences/1868502-letude-polemique-de-raoult-sur-la-chloroquine-enfin-retractee-elle-na-plus-aucune-valeur.html

Les politiciens s’étonnent à chaque sondage de l’islamisation de la France. Mais pendant 50 ans, ils ont importé des millions de musulmans en leur disant que l’islam était compatible avec la France.

Ce mensonge est le péché originel de notre conquête par l’islam.

Il est temps d’acter leur échec et de refuser l’islamisation du pays. Deux solutions : la remigration et l’affirmation de notre identité chrétienne !

Olivier, avant de parler de “conquête par l’islam”, il faudrait rappeler quelques faits essentiels. Oui, la France s’est construite sur une longue tradition d’accueil (politiques de migration du Maghreb, d’Afrique, d’Asie…), mais l’idée de “problème musulman” généralisé est une extrapolation anxiogène. Les enquêtes sérieuses montrent que la majorité des musulmans en France respectent les lois de la République, travaillent, éduquent leurs enfants et participent à la vie collective, comme n’importe quel citoyen.​

Le sondage utilisé pour faire peur est souvent sorti de son contexte ou instrumentalisé. Une proportion qui estime que la charia devrait s’appliquer dans tous les pays ne signifie pas que tous veulent imposer leurs normes, ni qu’il existe un projet “d’islamisation” coordonné. L’attachement à la religion est réel dans toutes les communautés, y compris chez les catholiques, les juifs ou les protestants.​

Quant à la “remigration” et à “l’affirmation identitaire chrétienne” : ce sont des slogans, pas des politiques viables, et surtout contraires aux valeurs républicaines d’égalité et de laïcité.

Viktor Orbán vient de publier sur X une charge d’une rare violence, mais d’une lucidité implacable, à l’encontre d’Ursula von der Leyen et du soutien inconditionnel à Kiev.

Je cite :
« Il est désormais évident qu’une mafia de la guerre détourne l’argent des contribuables européens. Au lieu d’exiger des comptes rigoureux ou de suspendre immédiatement les versements, la présidente de la Commission propose d’augmenter encore les transferts. C’est exactement comme si l’on prétendait aider un alcoolique en lui livrant une caisse supplémentaire de vodka. La Hongrie, pour sa part, refuse de perdre la raison. »

Rarement une métaphore n’aura aussi précisément résumé l’absurdité et le scandale de la situation actuelle : des milliards continuent de couler vers un régime gangrené par la corruption avérée, sans aucun mécanisme de contrôle sérieux, pendant que les peuples européens subissent austérité et inflation.

Orbán ne fait pas que critiquer ; il pose la seule question qui vaille encore : jusqu’à quand accepterons-nous de financer un désastre dont les bénéficiaires ne sont ni les Ukrainiens ordinaires, ni les Européens, mais une poignée d’oligarques et de profiteurs de guerre ?

Orbán est fidèle à sa posture anti-UE et pro-russe, et sa rhétorique sur le “gaspillage” ou la “mafia de la guerre” sert surtout à légitimer sa propre blocage des aides et de l’intégration de l’Ukraine à l’Union européenne. Mais les faits sont plus nuancés : la Commission européenne a renforcé ses contrôles de fonds attribués à Kiev depuis 2023, avec audits indépendants et suspension de transferts en cas d’anomalie. Omettre ces efforts, c’est faire croire que tout soutien européen se ferait à perte et sans surveillance, alors que chaque versement est conditionné et soumis à révision.​

Sur la corruption, la Hongrie n’est pas un exemple à suivre : Budapest est régulièrement critiquée, y compris par Bruxelles, pour ses propres détournements de fonds européens, et Viktor Orbán bloque l’aide à l’Ukraine en utilisant des arguments qui masquent surtout ses intérêts énergétiques et ses ambitions politiques internes.​

Comparer le soutien à Kiev à “livrer de la vodka à un alcoolique”, c’est nier les efforts réels pour soutenir une population agressée et empêcher l’annexion militaire en Europe. L’alternative proposée par Orbán reviendrait à valider l’invasion russe et affaiblir les valeurs démocratiques sur tout le continent.​

L’administration Trump ordonne aux ambassades américaines de surveiller l’impact de la migration en Europe
- Les ambassades américaines sommées de rendre compte des impacts présumés de la migration sur les droits humains et la sécurité publique, en citant des cas au Royaume-Uni, en Suède et en Allemagne
Le département d’État américain a annoncé vendredi avoir demandé à ses ambassades de dresser des rapports sur les conséquences présumées en matière de droits humains liées à la migration de masse en Europe, notamment au Royaume-Uni, en Suède et en Allemagne.
L’administration évoque des informations faisant état d’agressions sexuelles et d’autres crimes impliquant des migrants dans ces pays, qualifiant la migration de masse de « menace existentielle pour la civilisation occidentale ».
« La migration de masse constitue une menace existentielle pour la civilisation occidentale et pourrait saper la stabilité de certains alliés clés des États-Unis », a affirmé le département dans un communiqué publié sur la plateforme sociale de la société X, basée aux États-Unis.
Les ambassades sont invitées à recueillir des informations sur les politiques jugées indulgentes envers la criminalité impliquant des migrants et les atteintes aux droits humains, ainsi que sur les lois susceptibles de sanctionner des citoyens exprimant leur opposition à la migration de masse.
La note cite plusieurs affaires présumées, dont des réseaux de prédation sexuelle dans certaines régions d’Angleterre, un jugement en Suède ayant permis à un migrant condamné pour agression sexuelle de rester dans le pays, ainsi qu’un viol collectif en Allemagne impliquant plusieurs hommes, certains décrits comme des migrants.
Cette décision s’inscrit dans la vaste offensive de l’administration Trump contre l’immigration aux États-Unis, marquée par un renforcement du contrôle aux frontières et des expulsions accrues.

Christian, l’initiative de Trump de faire surveiller la migration européenne par les ambassades américaines s’inscrit dans une politique très restrictive promue depuis son retour en 2025, dans un contexte où chaque incident impliquant des migrants est monté en épingle pour servir une rhétorique de “menace existentielle”. Pourtant, les chiffres globaux montrent aussi une baisse des entrées irrégulières et un durcissement des frontières dans l’UE, loin du laxisme caricaturé dans certains discours.​

Il est essentiel de distinguer les faits divers tragiques, toujours instrumentalisés politiquement, de la réalité statistique : la majorité des migrants ne commet pas de crimes, et la majorité des infractions, comme en France, restent le fait de nationaux. Combattre la criminalité et défendre les droits humains sont des objectifs légitimes, mais la stigmatisation d’une population entière mine la justice et la cohésion sociale, et ne résout rien sur le fond.​

il est plus facile de donner avec l'argent des autres. Supprimons toutes les subventions à l'Ukraine, Gaza, Algérie, ... et les impôts n'auront pas besoin d'augmenter.
Renvoyons les migrants illégaux dans leur pays (pas de visas, pas de séjours), plus de Paiement SS pour les étrangers, plus de retraites pour les étrangers n'ayant pas côtisés, plus de soins tant que l'ardoise n'est pas épongée quitte à prendre sur les avoirs de ces pays détenus en France.

🇫🇷🔥 “Il faut arrêter l’aide humanitaire à l’Ukraine et à Gaza ! On n’a plus de sous !” — Pascal Praud

💥 Une phrase choc qui résume le ras-le-bol :
👉 La France distribue des milliards à l’étranger,
👉 Pendant que ses propres citoyens peinent à boucler les fins de mois.

📌 Hôpitaux en crise, écoles délabrées, retraites rabotées…
Et pourtant, on continue d’envoyer des chèques sans fin.

🎭 La solidarité internationale ne doit pas se faire au détriment des Français.
Quand le pays s’endette, quand les services publics s’effondrent,
👉 La priorité doit être nationale.

L'extrême-droite populiste et la machine à perdre les prochaines élections !

La question de l’aide humanitaire est légitime et mérite un débat public, mais il faut rappeler quelques réalités :

- L’aide humanitaire française, même si elle est importante, représente une part très faible du budget de l’État (moins de 1 % du budget total) et a été réduite ces dernières années, passant de près d’un milliard d’euros à environ 500 millions en 2025.​
https://www.senat.fr/rap/l24-144-34/l24-144-34_mono.html

- Les principaux bénéficiaires sont des pays en situation de crise extrême (conflits, famines, catastrophes naturelles), et l’aide est souvent ciblée sur des populations vulnérables, pas sur des États ou des gouvernements.​

- Les politiques d’immigration, de sécurité sociale et de retraite sont des sujets distincts : les migrants en situation régulière bénéficient de droits liés à leur statut, et les soins médicaux d’urgence sont garantis à tous, y compris aux étrangers, par principe humanitaire et par la loi.​

- La solidarité internationale n’est pas une alternative à la solidarité nationale, mais un complément : elle répond à des urgences mondiales, et son montant est négligeable comparé aux dépenses publiques françaises.

Pierre Pracquin- Antoine Antoine, votre ressenti est parfaitement légitime : l’inquiétude face à la précarité, à la difficulté de “joindre les deux bouts” et au sentiment de perte de contrôle sur les dépenses publiques, c’est un vécu partagé par beaucoup. Mais justement, c’est dans ces moments qu’il est essentiel de ne pas céder aux raccourcis ; regarder la réalité à travers “une lorgnette”, c’est le risque de simplifier à l’excès et de pointer l’argent “parti ailleurs” sans voir tout le tableau : fraudes, inefficacités, manque de contrôle, mais aussi solidarités nécessaires et investissements pour éviter de plus gros problèmes à terme.​

Le “ras-le-bol” existe, il faut l’entendre. Mais pour avancer, il faut garder la rigueur des faits : une politique juste, c’est celle qui cible vraiment les causes des difficultés sans création de bouc-émissaire, et qui contrôle l’argent public avec transparence, tout en respectant les droits de tous. Mieux piloter, plus d’équité, plus d’efficacité : c’est ce qui permet de retrouver confiance, et pas seulement dénoncer “ceux d’ailleurs”.

When I started doing independent Covid research, it was very surprising that it seemed to not be appreciated.
Why not leave it to the "experts"?
One of my early observations was that broad clinical knowledge was more important especially with Covid.
Now, the responsibility is to ensure science is thoroughly understood.
Sadly, it is now like rebellion after challenging the narrative.

John Castleman I actually think we’re closer than it sounds, John.

Part 1.

When a big dataset says “on average X is safe/effective” and a clinician like Philip is seeing edge cases, the next question absolutely should be: who are the exceptions, and how do we find them early? That’s not a rebellion against population science; it’s the whole point of doing it properly. Every decent vaccine or drug paper already splits the curve: age, sex, comorbidities, prior infection, dose, etc. The myocarditis signal in young men is itself a global conclusion about a small subgroup.

Where I’m less convinced is the “medical cartel–approved science” frame. Large cohorts, registries and trials aren’t about enforcing obedience; they’re just the best tools we have to figure out whether a pattern seen in one clinic is (a) common, (b) concentrated in certain profiles, or (c) mostly noise. If Philip’s signals are real and important, those are exactly the instruments that will show it, provided he and others turn their observations into testable definitions and share enough detail for people who don’t already agree with him to check.

🧩 The vaccine question everyone avoids: Why do some children regress after vaccination while population studies show no risk increase?
My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.
The article includes a graph showing autism diagnoses corrected for diagnostic expansion, overlaid with glyphosate introduction into food supply. The correlation is striking—and backed by mechanistic studies in BMJ and PNAS.
This isn't anti-vaccine. It's anti-oversimplification.

Alfredo De Joannon Alfredo, I actually really appreciate how you handled the “garbage” verdict here; forcing us all to move from vibes to “which claim, exactly, and on what evidence?” is the only way any of this gets unstuck.

Part 1.

From my side, I’d frame it like this:

- The glyphosate > dysbiosis > neuroinflammation mechanism is biologically plausible and supported by enough animal / in vitro work to justify serious prospective human studies. That’s a long way from “garbage”, but it’s also not yet “we’ve explained a big share of autism trends.”

- The “vulnerable subgroup invisible to retrospective epi” problem is real as a possibility: if the defining biology isn’t measured, the signal gets smeared into the average. At the same time, the lack of any consistent excess in very large vaccine–autism cohorts still tells us something important: if such a subgroup exists, it’s either small in size or modest in effect at the population level.

My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.

Research has shown that glyphosate & organophosphate pesticides suppress the IR as well, and make it more difficult for the immune system to fight pathogen. (Citations stacked about a foot deep if anyone would like me to share?) 

The effects of organophosphates on the Salmonid Immune System was my grad research & the challenge pathogen was a deadly virus. 

This is interesting, thank you for sharing.

Alfredo De Joannon Really interesting to hear Victoria’s experience, Alfredo; cross-species immunotoxicology is exactly the kind of thing that should make regulators sit up straighter.

Where my “epi brain” still taps the brakes a bit is on how we frame this for lay readers. Lots of environmental stressors (pesticides, air pollutants, chronic infections, nutrition, stress) can nudge the immune system toward “suppressed or dysregulated”, so what you describe is almost a generic definition of vulnerability rather than a glyphosate-specific fingerprint.

I’m totally on board with:
- glyphosate + other pesticides as serious candidate contributors to that vulnerability,
- and the idea that any big immune hit (infection or vaccine) might act as the “last straw” in a small subgroup.

I’d just keep stressing that “different lines of research are converging” = we now have enough biological plausibility to justify prospective human studies, not that we’ve already identified the mechanism behind regression cases. If your model ends up being the one that survives those tougher tests, I’ll happily say you were ahead of the curve.

Part 3.

4. Where I fully agree with you:

- It’s not helpful to pretend parental observations are all “coincidence”.

- It’s also not helpful to pin everything on vaccines when we have reasonably strong evidence that routine childhood vaccines, as used so far, are not a major driver of autism at the population level.
https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/vaccines-do-not-cause-autism

- Environmental toxicology (pesticides, air pollution, endocrine disruptors, heavy metals) absolutely deserves more funding and better, prospective designs.

The “vaccine vs coincidence” fight is a dead end. The real work is gene–environment–development interaction: who’s vulnerable, to which exposures, and at what windows in time?

Your “perfect storm” model is a useful hypothesis generator, but it still needs to do the boring, unglamorous thing Barbara McClintock did: survive contact with large, carefully controlled human data, not just correlations and rodent curves.

If your piece pushes people toward that level of rigour, I’m all for it.

    - Newer scoping reviews do say “there might be something here”, but they also stress that the human data are heterogeneous, with lots of residual confounding.
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691525003898

    So: plausible candidate risk factors, yes. Settled “perfect storm” with a graph that explains the autism curve, not yet.

    3. “ANY immunological stressor” is doing a lot of work.

    If your model is that a damaged microbiome + pollution + endocrine disruptors create a subgroup where any acute immune hit (infection, vaccine, whatever) can tip a child into regression, then two hard questions follow:
    - Why don’t we see a higher autism risk after vaccines in the big datasets, if those hits are such powerful triggers?
    - How do we separate “immune trigger as last straw” from the natural timing of when early-childhood neurodevelopmental differences first become obvious?

    Those are exactly the kinds of questions that need quantitative answers, not just a nice conceptual diagram.

    Alfredo De Joannon Really appreciate this exchange, Alfredo, especially the honesty of “we can’t yet” on the trigger vs timing problem. That’s exactly the kind of admission that should start a research agenda, not end a debate.

    I’m completely with you that the next step has to be prospective: kids characterised before immune hits (infections and vaccines), with gut/microbiome, toxicant load and inflammation on the table, then followed through the windows where regression is most often reported. Your diagram is a perfectly valid way to generate those hypotheses, as long as we keep signalling clearly to lay readers that it’s a map of what to test, not a solved puzzle.

    Where I think we’re fully aligned now is:
    - retrospective big-data work has probably told us as much as it can about “vaccines vs autism” at the population level;
    - the really interesting questions now live in gene–environment–development interactions and vulnerable subgroups;
    - and that needs designs built around biology (microbiome, pollution, endocrine disruptors), not just administrative codes.

    If your piece nudges funders and teams toward that kind of prospective cohort, then my nit-picking will have done its job.

    I like the “anti-oversimplification” goal a lot, Alfredo, but I think you’re overselling how paradoxical this really is.

    Part 1.

    A few thoughts:

    1. Population studies already allow for vulnerable subgroups.

    Large cohorts/meta-analyses looking at vaccines and autism (MMR, thimerosal, schedule, etc.) haven’t just been tiny averages; they include >1 million children and still don’t see a signal, even in higher-risk families. 
    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/

    That doesn’t disprove a small, genetically or environmentally primed subgroup, but it does put a ceiling on how big that effect can be.

    2. The glyphosate/toxicity story is interesting but still early and noisy.

    - The BMJ California pesticide paper you’re alluding to found only modest odds ratios for autism with ambient glyphosate exposure (about 1.1–1.3), alongside similar signals for several other pesticides.
    https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l962

    - The PNAS and other rodent studies showing “autism-like” behaviours after high-dose maternal glyphosate are mechanistically suggestive, but they’re in animals, at exposure patterns that don’t map cleanly onto everyday human diet.

    Alfredo De Joannon Thanks again for the thoughtful follow-up, Alfredo; this is exactly the level of nuance the topic needs.

    On glyphosate/regulation, I agree early risk assessments leaned heavily on “no shikimate pathway in humans” and paid far less attention to the microbiome than we would today. In that sense, yes, there’s a conceptual regulatory blind spot your argument is poking at.

    Where I’d still add a bit of caution is the jump from “blind spot” to “this explains a big chunk of the autism curve.” Even without measuring microbiome status directly, if a sizeable vulnerable subgroup was being pushed over the edge by immune hits, we’d usually expect some consistent excess to bleed through into the big vaccine–autism cohorts or time-series, especially in higher-risk strata. So for now I’d file the glyphosate–dysbiosis–neuroinflammation route as:
    - biologically plausible,
    - supported by some suggestive animal/human data,
    -– but still needing prospective human work before it can carry much explanatory weight.

    And I’m 100% with you on the last sentence: “synergistic interaction in biologically vulnerable subgroups” is a hypothesis that does require prospective investigation.

    Those are exactly the kinds of questions that need quantitative answers, not just a nice conceptual diagram.

    Alfredo De Joannon Really appreciate this exchange, Alfredo, especially the honesty of “we can’t yet” on the trigger vs timing problem. That’s exactly the kind of admission that should start a research agenda, not end a debate.

    I’m completely with you that the next step has to be prospective: kids characterised before immune hits (infections and vaccines), with gut/microbiome, toxicant load and inflammation on the table, then followed through the windows where regression is most often reported. Your diagram is a perfectly valid way to generate those hypotheses, as long as we keep signalling clearly to lay readers that it’s a map of what to test, not a solved puzzle.

    Where I think we’re fully aligned now is:
    - retrospective big-data work has probably told us as much as it can about “vaccines vs autism” at the population level;
    - the really interesting questions now live in gene–environment–development interactions and vulnerable subgroups;
    - and that needs designs built around biology (microbiome, pollution, endocrine disruptors), not just administrative codes.

    If your piece nudges funders and teams toward that kind of prospective cohort, then my nit-picking will have done its job.

    🧩 The vaccine question everyone avoids: Why do some children regress after vaccination while population studies show no risk increase?
    My new analysis explores this paradox through the lens of environmental toxicology—and the answer isn't what either "side" wants to hear.
    It's not vaccines as direct cause (the data falsify this). It's not "just coincidence" either (too many parental observations to dismiss).
    It's a "perfect storm": glyphosate-damaged microbiomes + ultrafine particulate pollution + endocrine disruptors creating a vulnerable subpopulation where ANY acute immunological stressor (vaccine OR natural infection) becomes the trigger.
    The article includes a graph showing autism diagnoses corrected for diagnostic expansion, overlaid with glyphosate introduction into food supply. The correlation is striking—and backed by mechanistic studies in BMJ and PNAS.
    This isn't anti-vaccine. It's anti-oversimplification.

    I like the “anti-oversimplification” goal a lot, Alfredo, but I think you’re overselling how paradoxical this really is.

    Part 1.

    A few thoughts:

    1. Population studies already allow for vulnerable subgroups.

    Large cohorts/meta-analyses looking at vaccines and autism (MMR, thimerosal, schedule, etc.) haven’t just been tiny averages; they include >1 million children and still don’t see a signal, even in higher-risk families. 
    https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/

    That doesn’t disprove a small, genetically or environmentally primed subgroup, but it does put a ceiling on how big that effect can be.

    2. The glyphosate/toxicity story is interesting but still early and noisy.

    - The BMJ California pesticide paper you’re alluding to found only modest odds ratios for autism with ambient glyphosate exposure (about 1.1–1.3), alongside similar signals for several other pesticides.
    https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l962

    - The PNAS and other rodent studies showing “autism-like” behaviours after high-dose maternal glyphosate are mechanistically suggestive, but they’re in animals, at exposure patterns that don’t map cleanly onto everyday human diet.

    Alfredo De Joannon Thanks again for the thoughtful follow-up, Alfredo; this is exactly the level of nuance the topic needs.

    On glyphosate/regulation, I agree early risk assessments leaned heavily on “no shikimate pathway in humans” and paid far less attention to the microbiome than we would today. In that sense, yes, there’s a conceptual regulatory blind spot your argument is poking at.

    Where I’d still add a bit of caution is the jump from “blind spot” to “this explains a big chunk of the autism curve.” Even without measuring microbiome status directly, if a sizeable vulnerable subgroup was being pushed over the edge by immune hits, we’d usually expect some consistent excess to bleed through into the big vaccine–autism cohorts or time-series, especially in higher-risk strata. So for now I’d file the glyphosate–dysbiosis–neuroinflammation route as:
    - biologically plausible,
    - supported by some suggestive animal/human data,
    -– but still needing prospective human work before it can carry much explanatory weight.

    And I’m 100% with you on the last sentence: “synergistic interaction in biologically vulnerable subgroups” is a hypothesis that does require prospective investigation.

    BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
     
     "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
     
     "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
     
     "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
     
     "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism." 
     
     "Of note, the 2014 Agency for Health Research and Quality review also addressed the HepB vaccine and autism. One cross-sectional study met criteria for reliability; it found a threefold risk of parental report of autism among newborns receiving a HepB vaccine in the first month of life compared to those who did not receive this vaccine or did so after the first month." 
     
     "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
     
     As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

    Tom Ritter Tom, a few quick clarifications:

    Part 1.

    1. Definitions didn’t suddenly flip from “immunity” to “immune response = disease.”
    For decades, immunology textbooks have defined a vaccine as something that induces an immune response that protects against disease. It was always understood that:
    - “Immunity” is partial and probabilistic (reduced risk / severity), not a magic forcefield.
    - Protection can be against infection, disease, or severe disease, depending on the pathogen and product.

    CDC did tighten its wording in 2021 from “produce immunity” to “stimulate an immune response,” largely because:
    - Not all licensed vaccines are sterilising (think flu, pertussis, oral polio in some settings).
    - Protection is measured as risk reduction, not a guarantee of zero cases.
    https://www.newsweek.com/science-fact-check-definition-vaccine-cdc-1964107

    That’s updating a sloppy definition to match long-standing reality, not inventing myocarditis by changing a noun.

    2. An “immune response” is not defined as myocarditis, clots, MS, or cancer.
    In immunology, immune response means:
    - activation of B cells, T cells, antibodies, cytokines, etc. in a way that improves defence against the target pathogen.

    The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine package insert includes more than just dosage instructions.

    It also outlines ingredients, reported adverse reactions, and how the vaccine was evaluated—information that’s often overlooked but important for anyone wanting to understand the full picture.

    Here’s what you should know: picdata.org/varicella-dis

    Reading the package insert is fine; we’d want any parent to know what’s in a vial and what’s been reported after it.

    But it’s worth remembering what an insert is and isn’t. It’s a legal document, not a balanced risk–benefit summary: it lists any adverse event reported in trials or post-marketing, even when causality is unclear, and it says almost nothing about what happens if you don’t vaccinate.
    https://www.fda.gov/media/76000/download

    If we zoom out to that “full picture”, the numbers are pretty stark. Before routine varicella vaccination in the U.S., each year there were >4 million cases, about 10,500–13,500 hospitalisations and 100–150 deaths, many in previously healthy kids. Since the programme started, cases, hospitalisations and deaths have fallen by >90%, and the vaccine now prevents an estimated 3.8 million cases, 10,500 hospitalisations and approx. 100 deaths every year.
    https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/vaccination-impact/index.html

    So yes: read the insert, talk about ingredients and side-effects. But informed consent also means putting those rare vaccine risks next to the very real burden of wild-type chickenpox, and the decades of data showing just how much that burden has dropped since we started using the vaccine.

     "In fact, there are still no studies that support the claim that any of the 20 doses of the seven infant vaccines recommended for American children before the first year of life do not cause autism. These vaccines include DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, PCV, rotavirus, and influenza." 
     
     As for the MMR vaccine, CDC's website now says: "In 2012, the IOM reviewed the published MMR-autism studies and found that all but four of them had 'serious methodological limitations,' and the IOM gave them no weight. The remaining four studies and a few similar studies published since also have all been criticized for serious methodological flaws. Furthermore, they are all retrospective epidemiological studies which cannot prove causation, fail to account for potential vulnerable subgroups, and fail to account for mechanistic and other evidence linking vaccines with autism."

    Tom Ritter Tom, a few quick clarifications:

    Part 1.

    1. Definitions didn’t suddenly flip from “immunity” to “immune response = disease.”
    For decades, immunology textbooks have defined a vaccine as something that induces an immune response that protects against disease. It was always understood that:
    - “Immunity” is partial and probabilistic (reduced risk / severity), not a magic forcefield.
    - Protection can be against infection, disease, or severe disease, depending on the pathogen and product.

    CDC did tighten its wording in 2021 from “produce immunity” to “stimulate an immune response,” largely because:
    - Not all licensed vaccines are sterilising (think flu, pertussis, oral polio in some settings).
    - Protection is measured as risk reduction, not a guarantee of zero cases.
    https://www.newsweek.com/science-fact-check-definition-vaccine-cdc-1964107

    That’s updating a sloppy definition to match long-standing reality, not inventing myocarditis by changing a noun.

    2. An “immune response” is not defined as myocarditis, clots, MS, or cancer.
    In immunology, immune response means:
    - activation of B cells, T cells, antibodies, cytokines, etc. in a way that improves defence against the target pathogen.
    Science fact check: Was the definition of COVID vaccine "changed"?
    Vaccine skeptics have said changes were introduced to "accommodate" the shortcomings of the COVID-19 vaccines.

    BOMBSHELL: The CDC has updated its "Autism and vaccines" page to start telling the truth, including: 
     
     "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism." 
     
     "Studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities." 
     
     "Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism. However, this statement has historically been disseminated by the CDC and other federal health agencies within HHS to prevent vaccine hesitancy." 
     
     "Multiple reports from HHS and the National Academy of Sciences ... have consistently concluded that there are still no studies that support the specific claim that the infant vaccines, DTaP, HepB, Hib, IPV, and PCV, do not cause autism and hence the CDC was in violation of the Data Quality Act when it claimed, 'vaccines do not cause autism.' CDC is now correcting the statement, and HHS is providing appropriate funding and support for studies related to infant vaccines and autism."

    A science hero against all odds and powerful industries. Just for humanity. 

    America in the 1950s was in love with a miracle chemical. DDT—the pesticide that would end hunger, eliminate disease, create paradise through science. They sprayed it everywhere.
    "Better living through chemistry," the ads promised.
    But Rachel Carson noticed something the ads didn't mention: the birds were disappearing.
    She was a marine biologist and nature writer, 55 years old, with a quiet but respected career. She wasn't an activist.

    She just wanted to understand why entire flocks of birds were dying after DDT sprayings. Why fish vanished from treated waterways. Why farm workers were getting mysteriously sick.
    She found something horrifying.
    DDT wasn't breaking down. It was accumulating—concentrating as it moved up the food chain from insects to birds to humans. It was causing cancer. Genetic damage. Widespread ecosystem collapse.
    Someone needed to tell the truth. So Rachel started writing.
    For four years, she researched what would become "Silent Spring"—combining rigorous science with prose so beautiful it read like poetry. She documented how pesticides were killing birds, contaminating water, poisoning soil, threatening everything alive.

    But Rachel had a secret.
    In 1960, while writing, doctors found a tumor in her breast. Cancer. Aggressive. Already spreading.

    She told almost no one.
    "Silent Spring" was published in September 1962.
    The reaction was explosive.
    The chemical industry declared war. Monsanto, DuPont, and other corporations launched a massive campaign to destroy her. They called her hysterical. Emotional. Unqualified. They attacked her credentials, her data, her motives. But Rachel stood firm.
    She appeared on television—calm, articulate, unshakable. She testified before Congress. She defended every claim with meticulous evidence. Even as her body quietly failed, she kept fighting publicly. 
    The chemical companies didn't know she was dying. The public didn't know.
    In letters to her friend Dorothy Freeman, Rachel explained why: she couldn't let them find out. If her enemies knew, they'd weaponize it. 

    The evidence supported her claims. President Kennedy ordered an investigation. Public opinion shifted. Suddenly, people were asking: What are we spraying on our food, on air? What legacy are we leaving our children?
    Rachel Carson had started a revolution.
    But she wouldn't live to see it completed.
    By 1963, cancer had spread throughout her body. She was in constant pain. Still, she kept working. Kept speaking.
    April 14, 1964. Rachel Carson died at home in Silver Spring, Maryland. She was 56 years old.
    She'd lived just two years after "Silent Spring" was published. 
    Her book sold over 2 million copies. Rachel Carson wad there—the quiet marine biologist who looked at dying birds and said, "Someone needs to tell the truth."
    Then told it. While dying. And changed the world anyway.
    Her voice wasn't silent.
    And because of that, spring still has its songs.

    The Rachel Carson story is powerful, Philip, but the part that made her convincing wasn’t that she was attacked, it was that she arrived with receipts.

    By the time Silent Spring landed, there were:
    - field data on bird and fish die-offs mapped to DDT use,
    - toxicology studies,
    - residue measurements up the food chain,
    - and a clear dose–response story that other scientists could reproduce.

    That’s the bit I’m still missing for “spike-protein autoimmunity as the hidden driver of today’s patterns”. We have:
    - case reports and small series of autoimmune phenomena after infection and vaccination,
    - plausible mechanisms at the bench,
    - but not yet large, controlled epidemiology showing specific autoimmune diseases rising in step with spike exposure, disentangled from infection, age, sex and background trends.

    Asking for that level of evidence isn’t “pretending there is no connection”; it’s exactly how Carson turned an uncomfortable hypothesis into something that survived hostile scrutiny.
